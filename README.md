## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I was really excited to find out how to make the results appear more natural and automatic with the input keyup event. This brought a very fluid effect to the app.

```js
numberPeople.addEventListener("keyup", function () {
  if (validateFields()) {
    calculate();
  }
  hasBeenReset = false;
  enableReset();
});
```

### Continued development

With this project I discovered some important subjects that I will continue to study to use in future projects, which are Regular Expressions and also Prototypes in javascript.
